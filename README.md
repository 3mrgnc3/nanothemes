# NANOthemes by crashie 

Here I will upload all themes I've made for the WiFi Pineapple NANO. Feel free to download and use them. Just SSH/SFTP into your NANO and replace the files on the NANO with the ones from corresponding folders in the .zip and then you're good to go.

If there's any issues let me know. To keep file sizes down I've modded bootstrap.min.css, main.css and in some cases the html for the dashboard and/or other modules. 

You'll find me over at the Hak5 forums or IRC if you want to get hold of me.

Cheers! / crashie
